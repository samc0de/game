# game
A basic game with components fairly separated for future growth of their own.

This repo tries to combine my interests: AI, Machine learning, Neural Networks (& fuzzy logic), game, graph algorithms, algorithmic efficiency, statistics & statistical inference, concurrency (multiple players), go lang (for high computation maybe?) to some extent, testing and GUI.

That's a huge list, so it will take time for them to show up (appear sufficiently). But the major weakness is only tihnk/plan & not to start anything, so I created this basic repo, with a simple enough topic & goal to start, so that there is actually some progress!
Many of these topics may and should evolve into their own projects/git submodules/git projects themselves, but let's just start!
JUST DO IT!
