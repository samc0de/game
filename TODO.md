Thinking about structure.
* Should it be a lib which can be imported and used in games? Or a framework
  which lays down the structure for those games. Personally I prefer libs over
  frameworks.
* ABC? Enforce methods like game.loop, config.stop_conditoins etc?
* Maybe add some common code, then add both framework and lib?
